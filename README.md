# Data-structures-and-algorithms

These are my assignments from my college class Data structures and algorithms. 

Point of this class is to:
  1.define static and dynamic data structures and standard algorithms to work with them (stack, heap, arrays, lists, trees, graphs, hash      tables, sorting and searching algorithms, min-max algorithms)
  2.show advantages and disadvantages of specific algorithms and data structures
  3.identify computer program bugs and to recognize required basic data structure operations
  4.form new solutions for programming problems or to improve already existing code with learned algorithms 
  5.assess algorithms and data stucture throu time and memory complexity of basic operations
