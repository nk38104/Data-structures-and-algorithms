# Data-structures-and-algorithms

These are my assignments from my college class Data structures and algorithms. 

Point of this class is to:<br>  
   1.define static and dynamic data structures and standard algorithms to work with them (stack, heap, arrays, lists, trees, graphs, hash      tables, sorting and searching algorithms, min-max algorithms)<br>  
   2.show advantages and disadvantages of specific algorithms and data structures<br>  
   3.identify computer program bugs and to recognize required basic data structure operations<br>  
   4.form new solutions for programming problems or to improve already existing code with learned algorithms <br>  
   5.assess algorithms and data stucture throu time and memory complexity of basic operations
